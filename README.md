# Mapping_Earthquakes
use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL


## Overview
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Deliverable 1 

**Requirements:**
1. The tectonic plate data is added as a second layer group.
2. The tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object.
3. The d3.json() callback is working and does the following:
* The tectonic plate data is passed to the geoJSON() layer
* The geoJSON() layer adds color and width to the tectonic plate lines
* The tectonic layer group variable is added to the map
4. The earthquake data and tectonic plate data displayed on the map when the page loads.

**Results with Pictures:**
